# Employee-Management-System
 
This project is an EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM called “FAST-EMS”, designed to manage employee information in a work environment. An employee management system consists of crucial work-related and important personal information about an employee, such as their salary, personal information, projects and work attendance/leaves. Concisely, it is an online inventory of all employees of an organization. 
Our EMS is deployed with two main users: Employees and Admin.
Employees will be registered by Admin who can manage their data, while employees are capable of viewing and editing some data.
The Admin can add new employees, assign projects to them, check project status and mark their projects, check employee Salary, and provide bonuses based on marks (automatic).
An Employee can view due Projects and Salary, submit their projects, apply for leaves and view or edit their profile information.
